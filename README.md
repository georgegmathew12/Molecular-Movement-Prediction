# Molecular-Movement-Prediction
This project was sponsored by NIH under Dr. Vance Jaeger at the University of Louisville. I built and trained a deep-learning neural network to learn how colloidal molecules move based on simulation data. This model was then applied to predict molecular movement given a subset of particles for a specified period of time.
